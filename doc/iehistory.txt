- new scanner for Windows iedownloadhistory index.dat file contents
File /users/<username>/appdata/roaming/microsoft/windows/iedownloadhistory/index.dat
contains download history and timestamp information from IE9.

Here is the data structure, contributed by Fornzix on linux_forensics on 6/26/12:
1. Records show up as gibberish until the computer is restarted for
some reason. Even shutting down IE9 didn't help. After the restart,
the records are readable.
2. Individual download records are sized in multiples of 128 bytes
(896,1024,1152,1280,.....).
3. Individual downloads start with "URL" (bytes 1-3).
4. Byte 4 = unknown.
5. Byte 5-6 = These two bytes make a 16 bit Integer which is the
length of the record in 128 byte chunks (i.e. hex 0B 00 = 11, and 11 x
128 = 1408, which is the total record length from "URL" to #12 below).
6. Bytes 17-24 = 8 byte Windows Date / Time when the download
finished.
7. Bytes 81-84 = 4 byte DOS (GMT) Time when download finished (funny
though... it's a few 1000's of a second longer than bytes 17-24)
8. Bytes 193-200 = 8 byte Windows Date / Time when the download
finished. (same as bytes 17-24)
9. Byte 469 = Start of download URL "http".
10. Three hex "00" in a row separate the end of the download URL from
the beginning of the location saved to on the hard drive.
11. There are three hex "00" at the end of the location where the file
was stored on the hard drive.
12. The remainder of the record, which could be considered 'slack
space' is taken up with hex EF:BE:AD:DE which is "DEADBEEF".

`bulk_extractor` is a high-performance digital forensics exploitation tool.
It is a "get evidence" button that rapidly 
scans any kind of input (disk images, files, directories of files, etc) 
and extracts structured information such as email addresses, credit card numbers,
JPEGs and JSON snippets without parsing the file
system or file system structures. The results are stored in text files that are easily 
inspected, searched, or used as inputs for other forensic processing. bulk_extractor also creates
histograms of certain kinds of features that it finds, such as Google search terms and email addresses, 
as previous research has shown that such histograms are especially useful in investigative and law enforcement applications.

Unlike other digital forensics tools, `bulk_extractor` probes every byte of data to see if it is the start of a 
sequence that can be decompressed or otherwise decoded. If so, the
decoded data are recursively re-examined. As a result, `bulk_extractor` can find things like BASE64-encoded JPEGs and
compressed JSON objects that traditional carving tools miss.

This is the `bulk_extractor` 2.0 development branch!  For information
about the `bulk_extractor` update, please see [Release 2.0 roadmap](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/blob/main/doc/ROADMAP_2.0.md).

Building `bulk_extractor`
=========================
To build bulk_extractor in Linux or Mac OS:

1. Make sure required packages have been installed. **You can do this by going into the etc/ directory and looking for a script that installs the necessary packages for your platform.**

2. Then run these commands:

```
./configure
make
make install
```

For detailed instructions on installing packages and building bulk_extractor, read the wiki page here:
https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/wiki/Installing-bulk_extractor

The Windows version of bulk_extractor must be built on Fedora using mingw.

BULK_EXTRACTOR 2.0 STATUS REPORT
================================
`bulk_extractor` 2.0 is now operational for development use. It
requires C++17 to compile. I am keeping be13_api and dfxml as a modules that are included, python-style, rather than making them stand-alone libraries that are linked against.

The project took longer than anticipated. In addition to updating to
C++17, I used this as an opportunity for massive code refactoring and
general increase in reliability.
